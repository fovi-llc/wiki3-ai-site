      "source": "## Using the `WebLLM Chat` kernel to run built-in-ai LLMs as JupyterLite kernels\n\nThe `WebLLM Chat` kernel (be sure it is selected in the kernel picker above) is derived from a JupyterLite kernel implemented by [Aleksandar Sekulovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandar-s-486829128/) at https://github.com/aleks-s10/agent-client-kernel/tree/main/lite-kernel.  This version currently lives at https://github.com/fovi-llc/built-in-ai-webllm-kernel with Python installer by [Jim White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulwhite/) and Copilot.  It will be moving to its own repo RSN.\n\nIt is a TS/JS kernel that wraps `@built-in-ai/web-llm` from https://github.com/jakobhoeg/built-in-ai which is an [AI SDK model provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/) for open-source models (using WebLLM) running directly in the browser by [Jakob Hoeg Mørk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-hoeg-moerk/).\n\n### &#128679; Under Construction &#128679; ###\nThere is no UX for things like errors/config issues, status, progress, etc yet.  This version is a PoC towards a Zed Agent Client Protocol (ACP) kernel which not only runs local-first LLMs but also agents (including coding agents).\n\nExample using the default, a \"small\" LLM: [SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC](https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC) which is 360M parameters quantized to 4bit and is 130MB.",

          "text": "Building a skyscraper out of straw is a fascinating concept, but it's important to understand that it's not a practical or achievable task in its entirety. Straw is a great material with some interesting properties, but it has limitations that make a skyscraper impossible to build with only straw. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the challenges and why it's not feasible:\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Structural Integrity:** Straw is fragile and not strong enough to support the immense weight of a skyscraper. It can easily collapse under pressure. \n* **Fire Safety:** Straw is highly flammable and would be a significant fire hazard. Fire safety measures are essential for skyscrapers, and straw wouldn't provide adequate protection. \n* **Building Codes:** Straw buildings would likely not meet modern building codes due to structural safety and fire safety requirements. \n* **Scalability:** The sheer scale of a skyscraper is difficult to achieve with straw alone.  Straw bales are typically used for smaller structures like shelters or temporary housing. \n* **Cost:** Building a skyscraper with straw would be incredibly expensive, considering the amount of straw needed and the complexity of construction. \n\n**However, straw building is still a viable option for smaller structures:**\n\n* **Straw bale construction** utilizes a more robust form of straw, woven together with a mixture of clay, straw, and mud to create stronger, more durable walls. \n* **Modern techniques:** Architects and engineers are constantly innovating with straw bale construction, finding ways to incorporate it into modern designs and enhance its capabilities.\n\n**Instead of building a skyscraper from scratch, you could:**\n\n* **Learn about straw bale building:**  Explore books, online resources, and local workshops to learn more about the techniques and materials involved.\n* **Model a straw bale structure:** Experiment with smaller-scale projects like a model house or a straw bale planter box to gain hands-on experience.\n* **Explore straw bale architecture:** Find architects and designers who are incorporating straw bale construction into their projects. \n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhile a skyscraper made entirely of straw is not realistic in the near future, straw building is a fascinating and sustainable alternative to traditional construction methods. With advancements in technology and innovation, straw could play a more significant role in building the future of architecture. \n"
