This version currently lives at https://github.com/wiki3-ai/webllm-chat-kernel with Python installer by [Jim White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulwhite/) and Copilot.\n\nIt is a TS/JS kernel that wraps WebLLM (https://webllm.mlc.ai/,  NPM `@mlc-ai/web-llm`) to run MLC LLMs hosted on HuggingFace ([HuggingFace MLC-LLM models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=mlc-llm))  directly in the browser using [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU) by [Jakob Hoeg Mørk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-hoeg-moerk/).\n\n## Next\n\nAfter you give this a whirl, check out https://wiki3.ai/wiki/built-in-chat.html which demonstrates the [Chrome/Edge Built-In AI Prompt API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api) in a JupyterLite kernel based on this `WebLLM Chat` kernel.\n\n### &#128679; Under Construction &#128679; ###\nThere is no UX for things like errors/config issues, status, progress, etc yet.  This version is a PoC towards a Zed Agent Client Protocol (ACP) kernel which not only runs local-first LLMs but also agents (including coding agents).\n\nExample using the default, a \"small\" LLM: [SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC](https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC) which is 360M parameters quantized to 4bit and is 130MB.",

Intricately fragrant, its scent borders the sweetest scents: the musky odours of pine, the smoky tang of honeysuckle, and the floral, citrusy aroma of lavender. Unlike the sweet flowers, their experience extends beyond DEFYING and ERROR: it denotes a dance of love, wonder, and enchantment.\n\nMay those wilder scents narrate the joy and enchantment of life itself. These roses might be the flip side of the flower, and flowers are not only beautiful but also the flower of love and beauty. As a companion to a rose, this fragrance accompanies them in their joys and sorrows, and their Melancholic Eiffel Tower, with its aroma filled with the sweet perfume of delight, reflects the deepest happiness created by love."

          "text": "What a unique and intriguing idea! Building a skyscraper out of straw can be a fun and creative project, but it's essential to consider the challenges and limitations involved. Here's a general guide to help you get started:\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Sustainable**: Straw is a highly renewable resource, making it an eco-friendly building material.\n2. **Fire-resistant**: Straw is a good insulator, which means it can help reduce fire spread in case of a fire.\n3. **Aesthetic**: A straw skyscraper can be a unique and visually appealing structure, adding character to a cityscape.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. **Structural integrity**: Straw is a lightweight, porous material that can be prone to collapse or failure under heavy loads or wind loads.\n2. **Fire safety**: Straw is not fire-resistant, and a fire could spread quickly through a straw structure.\n3. **Wind resistance**: Straw can be easily damaged by high winds, which can make it difficult to build a stable structure.\n4. **Moisture issues**: Straw can be susceptible to moisture damage, which can lead to mold and mildew growth.\n\n**Design Considerations:**\n\n1. **Choose the right straw**: Opt for a high-quality, dry straw that's less prone to moisture issues.\n2. **Select a suitable building style**: Consider a design that incorporates airtight spaces, such as a shell or a covered structure, to reduce wind and moisture exposure.\n3. **Use a sturdy foundation**: Ensure your foundation is solid and can support the weight of the structure.\n4. **Design for wind resistance**: Consider adding windbreaks or wind-resistant features to your design.\n\n**Building Process:**\n\n1. **Prepare the site**: Clear the land, and create a level foundation.\n2. **Build the base**: Construct a base using a combination of straw and other materials, such as sand or gravel.\n3. **Add the walls**: Stack straw walls on top of each other, using a combination of mortar and straw fibers.\n4. **Finish the exterior**: Cover the exterior of the structure with a waterproof material, such as a straw-based membrane or a standard waterproofing material.\n\n**Important Safety Notes:**\n\n1. **Consult local building codes**: Ensure your design complies with local building codes and regulations.\n2. **Consider wind loads**: Be aware of the wind loads that your structure will be subject to.\n3. **Use proper construction techniques**: Follow established building methods to ensure structural integrity and stability.\n\nPlease keep in mind that building a straw skyscraper can be a complex and potentially challenging project. It's essential to research and consider all the factors involved before embarking on such a project."
